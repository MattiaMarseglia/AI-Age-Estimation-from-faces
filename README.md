## Introduction

The primary goal of this project is to develop a robust age estimation model using Artificial Vision. The model utilizes a deep learning architecture trained on a dataset of facial images to predict the age of individuals. Age estimation has applications in various fields, including human-computer interaction, security systems, and personalized content delivery.

## Model Architecture

The core of the project is the age estimation model, which incorporates a deep neural network architecture. The model's code and pre-trained weights are available in the `modelAndScripts/` directory.

For a detailed understanding of the model architecture, refer to the [Model Architecture Documentation](2023_GTA_Contest_Report_Template_Definitivo.pdf).

## Dataset

The model was trained on a diverse dataset of facial images, encompassing a wide range of ages, ethnicities, and genders. The dataset used for training and evaluation is available at [Dataset Repository](https://dataset-repo-url.com).

## Results
